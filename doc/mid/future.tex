\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

In this project, we did the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Profiled to find the hotspots, look into the vectorization report.
\item Optimized our code based on our finding, get a factor of more than 10.
\item Successfully parallel our code through MPI, board-cast algorithm, get the right answer.
\item Use non-blocking communication to speed up the MPI code.
\item Build up a mode to analysis the performance of our MPI code in terms of strong scaling and MPI
	  efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

From our result, we learned:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Non-blocking communication can help speed up the program, but it might not be that ideal.
\item When the size of a job is not large enough, the efficiency of MPI calculation maybe influenced.
\end{enumerate}
