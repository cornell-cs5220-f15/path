\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%Taejoon%
The Floyd\textendash Warshall algorithm, in computer science, is an algorithm
for finding the minimum paths in a weighted graph. (i.e. All-pairs shortest
    path problem)

Our goal in this assignment includes:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Profiling: To find the bottleneck of the code.
  \item Parallelization : To make it parallel by using MPI.
  \item Optimization (Tuning) : Finally, tune it aggressively to get highest
                                performance.
\end{enumerate}


The rest of the report is organized as follows. In
Section~\ref{sec:profile},
we introduce a baseline timing result from initial copy, and show our
profiling result. 
Section~\ref{sec:parallel} discusses our approach for
parallelization-related work and Section~\ref{sec:vector} discusses
vectorization and parallelization. Our evaluation result will be shown in
Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:summary} concludes the
report.
