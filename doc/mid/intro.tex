\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

In this project, we analyze the OpenMP version of Floyd-Warshall algorithm by profiling the code using Vtune to identify bottlenecks. The Vtune profiling result is shown in section \secref{profiling}. To tune the code, we explore different compiler flags (section \secref{compilerflags}) and slightly vectorized the code (section \secref{vectorization}). Finally we perform strong and weak scaling in section \secref{evaluation}.
