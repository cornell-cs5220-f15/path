  \caption{\textbf{Performance comparison of MPI implementation with copy-optimized Open MP and the initial (un-optimized) Open MP implementation on graphs of size n = 200 to n = 8000 --} Performance of MPI surpasses that of Optimized Open MP at n = 2000 and below, where it benefits from running the computation on multiple processors. As n increases > 2000, the overheads from synchronizing memory access between the processors outweighs the performance gains and we see Optimized OpenMP performing better than MPI.}
