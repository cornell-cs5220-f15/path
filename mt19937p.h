/* mt19937p.h
 *
 * This is a version of the Mersenne Twister (aka mt19937) that is designed for
 * parallel use. Usage:
 *
 * struct mt19937p myMT19937;
 * sgenrand(seed,&myMT19937);
 * randomNumber = genrand(&myMT19937);
 *
 * Simply create different mt19937p structures for your different streams.
 * Disclaimer & Warning: This has only been lightly tested and has shown that it
 * generates identical sequences as mt19937.c! Use at your own risk!
 *
 * Massaged into parallel for my Austen McDonald <austen@cc.gatech.edu>
