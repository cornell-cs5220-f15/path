\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In this assignment we develop a set of optimized and parallelized programs to
compute the shortest path between all pars of vertices in a directed graph. In
\secref{profiling}, we profile the release implementation which uses a repeated
squares $O(N^3 \log N)$ algorithm. In \secref{algo}, we describe the repeated
squares algorithm in depth, and we present two additional algorithms that we
implemented: a blocked repeated squares algorithm and the Floyd-Warshall
algorithm. In \secref{parallelization}, we describe the three parallelization
mechanisms we used: OpenMP, MPI, and a hybrid of the two. Finally in
\secref{eval} and \secref{conclusion}, we evaluate the performance of our
implementations and conclude.
