\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In this assignment we are optimizing an algorithm which determines the shortest
path between all nodes in a graph in $O(\log(N)N^3)$. We focus on profiling,
tuning, and parallelization with MPI. We were also interested in comparing this
slower algorithm to Floyd$-$Warshall which can be done in $O(N^3)$, but has a
larger number of synchronizations $O(N)$ rather than $O(\log(N))$ for parallel
code.
