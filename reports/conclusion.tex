\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, we have implemented an optimized and parallelized implementation
of \rs{}, \block{}, and \fw{} using OpenMP, MPI, and a hybrid of the two. The
optimization of the implementations was guided by profiles generated by VTune
Amplifier and \icc{}. Ultimately, our \block{} implementations are roughly an
order of magnitude faster than the release implementation and our other
implementations for large graphs.
