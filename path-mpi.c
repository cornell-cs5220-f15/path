/**
 * # The basic recurrence
 *
 * At the heart of the method is the following basic recurrence.
 * If $l_{ij}^s$ represents the length of the shortest path from
 * $i$ to $j$ that can be attained in at most $2^s$ steps, then
 * $$
 *   l_{ij}^{s+1} = \min_k \{ l_{ik}^s + l_{kj}^s \}.
 * $$
 * That is, the shortest path of at most $2^{s+1}$ hops that connects
 * $i$ to $j$ consists of two segments of length at most $2^s$, one
 * from $i$ to $k$ and one from $k$ to $j$.  Compare this with the
 * following formula to compute the entries of the square of a
 * matrix $A$:
 * $$
 *   a_{ij}^2 = \sum_k a_{ik} a_{kj}.
 * $$
 * These two formulas are identical, save for the niggling detail that
 * the latter has addition and multiplication where the former has min
 * and addition.  But the basic pattern is the same, and all the
 * tricks we learned when discussing matrix multiplication apply -- or
 * at least, they apply in principle.  I'm actually going to be lazy
 * in the implementation of `square`, which computes one step of
 * this basic recurrence.  I'm not trying to do any clever blocking.
 * You may choose to be more clever in your assignment, but it is not
 * required.
 *
 * The return value for `square` is true if `l` and `lnew` are
 * identical, and false otherwise.
